Migrated to Python3.

To run, type:

python3 Amphetype.py


Depends on:

python-qt4  (that is, PyQt 4.3+)

OPTIONAL: py-editdist from http://www.mindrot.org/projects/py-editdist/
 - This latter dependancy is by no means critical and you will
 probably never get to use it. (For fetching words from a wordfile
 that are "similar" to your target words in the lesson generator.)
 If you don't have the module it will just select random words
 instead

TODO: Port to PyQt5.
